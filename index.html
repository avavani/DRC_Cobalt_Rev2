                <h2>Cobalt is a key component in Lithium-ion batteries.</h2>
                <p>All modern consumer electronics from electric cars to mobile phones function thanks to this element.</p>

                <h2>Li-on batteries store and release energy by moving ions between the positive and negative node.</h2>
                <p>When the battery is charging, the ions move from postive to negative and when the battery is discharging, the ions move negative to positive. This back and forth movement of the ions stores and releases electricity that powers our devices.</p>

                <h2>Cobalt unique elemental properties makes this process stable and portable.</h2>
                <p>An outer ring with only 2 electrons and high energy density allows cobalt to maintain stability in the cathode. Without it, our electronic devices would be more prone to overheating, retain less power and would need to be charged and <b>replaced</b> more frequently.</p>

                <h2>Today, much of the world's cobalt comes from one countryâ€”the Democratic Republic of Congo.</h2>
                <p>The DRC's mineral wealth has supported almost all new technologies of the lasat century at a very high human cost.</p>

                <h2>In the early 1900s, the DRC was responsible for motorizing the world.</h2>
                <p>When King Leopold II began Belgium's brutal reign of the regions near the basin of the Congo River in 1885, he did so to control the region's supply of ivory and rubber.</p>
            </article>
            <div class="slide" data-type="image" id="photo5" data-format="jpg">
                <h2>An inhumane regime of forced labour imposed by the Belgians in the region meant that by 1903, the "Congo Free State" was the largest supplier of rubber in the world.</h2> 
                <p>An estimated 5.9 thousand metric tons of rubber were exported out of the country, just in time to support the European demand for automobile and bicycle tires.</p>

            <article class="slide" data-type="map" id="second-slide">
                <h2>Though prices of rubber eventually fell due to competition from the Asian colonies, DRC's deposits of Gold, Silver, and Diamond ensured that European interest in the region would continue.</h2>
                <p>These mines enriched the coffers of Belgium and England, a welcome source of income after the devastation of the First World War. The European powers were keenly aware of the importance of DRC's wealth in their economic recovery, as highlighted by Louis Frank, the Belgian Minister of the Colonies in 1924:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"The valuable deposits are worked to their <b>best economical possibilities</b>, and with due care for the native population...The Congo has <b>enormous potential wealth</b>. It has a <b>great future</b>. It certainly add a splendid asset to the possessions and credit of Belgium."</p></blockquote>

                <h2>A few years later, DRC's copper deposits became of growing interest for the colonial powers.</h2>
                <p>The growth of telegraph and electricity increased the demand for copper wiring and the metal became the country's leading export. Today, the DRC is the second largest producer of Copper behind Chile.</p>

                <h2>When the mushroom cloud fell on Hiroshima killing a hundred and forty thousand civilians, it did so thanks to Congolese uranium.</h2>
                <p>For the next half century, access to the Shinkolobwe mine became a question of key geopolitical importance for anyone looking to establish their nuclear program while the local Congolese miners dealt with the effects of radioactive exposure.</p>

                <h2>Most of DRC's mineral wealth is found in the south-east region of DRC known as Katanga.</h2>
                <p>Alongside copper, gold, silver, and uranium Katanga also had deposits of tin, germanium, radium, zinc, lithium, cadmium, and manganese.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="slide" data-type="map" id="sixth-slide">
                <h2>It is hence not surprising that control over Katanga remains a priority for politicians, militias, and international conglomerates.</h2>
                <p>When Patrice Lumumba, DRC's first democratically elected leader, challenged Western mining interests, the mineral-rich province of Katanga was pushed into secession.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, when Lumumba was overthrown in a US and Belgium backed coup, he was handed over to Katangan secessionists in Elizabethville (today Lubumbashi) to be violently tortured and executed.</p>

                <h2>Today, Katanga again finds itself as an integral part of the global supply chain thanks to its large and abundant deposits of cobalt.</h2>
                <p>Around 30% of the world's total <b>cobalt</b> supply lies in this region, at depths so shallow that is can be extracted by anyone with a shovel.</p>
                <p>While large industrial sites run by Congolese and Chinese partnership dominate Katanga's formal mining sector, the region is also home to countless smaller, illegal, "artisanal mines".</p>

            <div class="slide" data-type="image" id="photo6" data-format="webp">
                <h2>Artisanal mining is a form of small-scale, informal mining that is often done with minimal machinery and technology.</h2>
                <p>In DRC, it is estimated that around 20% of the country's cobalt production comes from artisanal mines. These mines are often dangerous and exploitative, with workers facing long hours, low pay, and hazardous working conditions.</p>
                <p>Children as young as seven years old are often found working in these mines, risking their lives to help support their families.</p>

            <article class="slide" data-type="map" id="eigth-slide">
                <h2>Once the intermediaries have sold the artisanal cobalt ore to wholesale sellers, they undergo a first step processing in local industrial factories.</h2>
                <p><b>Cobalt processing factories</b> operate under no environmental legislation and as a result often dump toxic by-products indiscriminately. Villagers living in the copper belts of Zambia and DRC often drink the water from polluted streams, and breathe toxic dust with 1000 times higher impurities than recommended by WHO.</p>

                <h2>Lack of infrastructure in the DRC means that most of the actual cobalt refinement is done in facilities of the Developed World.</h2>
                <p>Around 65% of current <b>cobalt refinement</b> (largely sourced from DRC) is done in China followed by Finland (11%) Belgium (5%) and Canada (5%). The few refinement facilities in DRC do not produce cobalt of sufficient high quality for industrial use and needs to be further processed abroad.</p>

                <h2>Cobalt's supply chain ends in factories that manufacture the electric goods that power our lives.</h2>
                <p>From Asia to Europe to the US, cobalt from the DRC is used in Lithium-Ion batteries that are essential for all electric goods from cars to phones.</p>
                <p>And with that, the Congolese people once again keep the world's newest technology running at the cost of their exploitation, as they have for the last 100 years.</p>
